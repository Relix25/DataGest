# Mission

DataGest provides factory operators with a safe desktop workflow to version image datasets using Git and DVC without terminal usage.

Core goals:
- predictable import, publish, fetch, and restore operations
- lock-based protection against concurrent dataset edits
- auditable history and rollback
- simple first-run setup through tool bootstrap
